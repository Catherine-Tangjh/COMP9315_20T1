a.
79
Each page has floor(4096 / 32) = 128 tuples.
So there are ceil(10000/128) = 79 pages.

b.
18
Each signature is ceil(58 / 8) = 8 bytes.
So each page can contain floor(4096/ 8) = 512 signatures.
Thus there are ceil(10000 / 512) = 20 signature pages.

c.
34
For data pages, there are 4 matches on different pages and 10 false matches on the other different pages, so 4 + 10 = 14 data pages are read.
And for signature pages, all the signature pages are read to find the matches.
Total pages are read are 20 + 14 = 34 pages.

d.
99
All the signature pages and data pages are read: 79 + 20 = 99 pages.

e.
Using Page signature or bit-slice signature in order to read less signature pages.

f.
k = 10, m = 7424
For page signature, use this formulae:
k = 1/loge2.loge(1/pF) = 10
m = (1/loge2)2.n.C.loge(1/pF) = 7362
n is 4 which is the number of the attribute values.
C is 128 bits which is the number tuples in one page.
We can also find from the formulae that the size of m in page signature is C times m of tuple signature.
So it is 128 * 58 = 7424
